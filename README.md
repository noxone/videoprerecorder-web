# Video Pre-Recorder

## AppStore

<!--Please find the app in the [Apple AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/.../...).-->

The app is supported on iPhones and iPads starting with iOS 16, respectively iPadOs 16.

## About

The app ``Video Pre-Recorder`` constantly records video while it is running. It buffers all video and audio data.

Once you press the trigger button to actually record a video, the app will start recording the video _including_ the buffered data. Thus, even if you press the trigger too late, you still got the interesting part on tape!


## Data Privacy

The application ``Video Pre-Recorder`` does not collect any personal information. All data is only stored on your device within the video files created when capturing videos using the app. The application does not send data anywhere.

## Support

For any other question or support request please create an [issue at github](https://github.com/noxone/videoprerecorder-web/issues).
